# Navigation Code

This code provides functionality for a smooth navigation menu and a fixed navigation bar that sticks to the top of the page when scrolling. It also includes smooth scrolling when clicking on links within the navigation menu.

## Getting Started

To use this code in your project, simply include it in your HTML file or add it to your JavaScript file.

### Prerequisites

There are no specific prerequisites for using this code. However, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to integrate it successfully into your project.

### Installation

1. Copy the code provided above into your JavaScript file or script tags in your HTML file.

## How to Use

The code includes three main functionalities: the navigation menu, smooth scrolling, and a fixed navigation bar.

### Navigation Menu

To use the navigation menu, make sure your HTML includes the following elements:

```html
<div class="nav__hamburger">...</div> <!-- This element represents the hamburger menu button -->
<div class="close__toggle">...</div> <!-- This element represents the close (X) button for the menu -->
<div class="nav__menu">...</div> <!-- This element represents the navigation menu itself -->
```

The code will handle the click events for opening and closing the menu.

### Smooth Scrolling

To enable smooth scrolling, make sure your navigation menu links have the class "scroll-link" and the `href` attribute set to the target element's ID. For example:

```html
<a class="scroll-link" href="#section1">Section 1</a>
<a class="scroll-link" href="#section2">Section 2</a>
<!-- Add more navigation links as needed -->
```

When the user clicks on these links, the page will smoothly scroll to the corresponding sections.

### Fixed Navigation Bar

The code also provides a fixed navigation bar functionality, which means the navigation bar will stick to the top of the page when the user scrolls down. To use this feature, make sure your HTML includes the following element:

```html
<nav class="navigation">...</nav> <!-- This element represents the navigation bar -->
```

The code will automatically apply the "fix__nav" class to the navigation bar when the user scrolls beyond its initial position.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the navigation menu and navigation bar by modifying the CSS styles and class names used in your HTML and CSS files.

## Compatibility

This code should work on modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
